This is what I did to address the issue:

Edited file: /opt/cpanel/ea-php##/root/etc/php-fpm.d/domain.com.conf
Added: 
Code:
request_terminate_timeout = 30s
In WHM »Service Configuration »Apache Configuration »Include Editor » Pre VirtualHost Include

(I chose all versions of apache)

I added:

Code:
<IfModule proxy_fcgi_module>
timeout 30
</IfModule>
This will fix the issue
